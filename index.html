            <p class="text-faded mb-4">ReliefRn was founded out of my admiration for older adults. I cared for my now deceased parents from afar. Families are under a great deal of stress as they have been forced to take on much greater caregiving roles for their loved ones while tending to the needs of their own families.  Older adults are often the victims of our disorganized, uncoordinated, and impersonal healthcare system. I recognize the need for a more holistic and efficient approach to care management; one that keeps things on an uninterrupted continuum. A skilled nurse can can close the communication and coordination gaps that put older adults at risk for injury, bad health outcomes, unnecessary hospitalizations and overuse of services. Unskilled caregivers play a critical role in the health care delivery process, but they cannot provide the same level of scrutiny and oversight that a skilled nurse can. Especially to those with chronic medical conditions.</p>

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">Physical and psychosocial assessment to determine specific needs. From there, we will formulate an individualized care plan designed to maximize safety and independence.  Professional and practical recommendations will be offered and we will put together an information file. Educating seniors and their families about all aspects of their care plan enables them to make informed decisions about how to achieve the best possible outcomes on both sides. Teaching families about specific medical conditions can reduce accidents and hospitalizations, and give you the confidence you need to promote quality care.</p><br><p>$650</p>

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">We can schedule visits to work through issues as they arise, but the main focus of the visit is to discuss the effectiveness of the care plan and make modifications as needed. We will evaluate the effect of any changes to the client’s general health or medications and do a complete safety checkup. We will make sure that all prescribed therapies are being followed and observe any change in mental status. We will address the client’s concerns and any additional needs. This may be a good opportunity for a wellness checkup.</p><br><p>$75/hour</p>

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">This is where I can assist older adults and their families with the implementation of the care plan.  This may include a number of services such as trouble shooting, coordination of services, and ongoing teaching. You might need help with arranging doctor visits or transporting them there where I assist with transitions to alternate facilities or back home. I will speak out for you and make sure your loved one is receiving the assistance they need and that their voices are being heard. This is especially valuable if you are caring for a frail loved one from afar and/or they are in an extended care facility.</p><br><p>$100/hour</p>

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">Planning for your loved one’s present and future needs cannot be underestimated. There are many sensitive issues surrounding the future needs of the elderly client. I can arrange family meetings  and facilitate discussions that tease out answers to thorny problems. The goal is to understand what the future looks like for everyone involved so that families can move forward with the planning process and prioritize care needs. I can be the objective “bad cop” and give unbiased  objective advice and suggestions. Here we can outline short and long term  goals, and discover how each family member’s individual strengths can most effectively  contribute to the overall care situation. Taking steps now will lessen anxiety and give everyone a better sense of control.</p><br><p>$125/hour</p>
